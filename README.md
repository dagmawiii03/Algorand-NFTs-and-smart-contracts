## Project Overview
Web3 technology is inherently about the user controlled internet. It is being achieved by a growing stack of decentralized technologies, such as blockchains, smart contracts, oracles, crypto wallets, storage networks, and more.   
## Business Objective
The client, 10 academy wants us to build an end-to-end web3 dapps on the Algorand blockchain that will help the client generate and distribute Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as certificates that will represent the successful completion of a weekly challenge to trainees and allow trainees with NFTs to interact with smart contract to perform pre-defined action.
